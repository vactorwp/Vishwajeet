  description: "With 4+ years of experience in web development, I’ve evolved from crafting tailored WordPress solutions to building scalable full-stack applications using React, Node.js, and API-driven architectures. I’m passionate about blending creativity with technology—transforming complex ideas into clean, user-friendly, and high-impact digital experiences. Recently, my curiosity has led me into the world of AI-driven projects and prompt engineering, where I’m exploring how intelligent systems can reshape modern applications. What drives me is not just writing code, but creating solutions that solve real problems, improve performance, and deliver value. Whether it’s optimizing a website from 37% to 98% speed on Google PageSpeed, building robust APIs, or experimenting with AI workflows, I thrive on innovation and continuous growth.",
